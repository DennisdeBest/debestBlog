#A bit of history ...

so let's take a bit of a look back at where this company started and how it got to be where it is today.
It all starts with the three founders Mathias Extremo, Adrien Castagnet and Julien Boyer who started a web development company while still in their last year in school, in 2010, Avril (April in french) Consulting was born, in may ...

The company took on its first employee in 2011, the same year it moved to Pessac (a suburb of Bordeaux) and started recruiting an artistic director and more.
In 2013 one of the founders, Julien, left to start What's Here a startup that uses Bluetooth chips in store to provide local feedback. In the meantime, Avril entered the mobile application market and released the app Touch Booking, an app that allows restaurants to take reservations and keep in touch with clients.
This lead them to fuse with the company search and connect in 2014 growing its total number of employees to about 10 and adding some specific skill sets to the team, especially one we will be talking about more later on, Prestashop.
At the end of this year, the firm had grown to 15 employees and it was time to move, this time to Mérignac another suburb of Bordeaux.
This allowed them to take on bigger projects for the year 2015 and they also used their time in Mérignac to collaborate more closely with other development firms in Bordeaux, diversify their activity and grow the client base.

In order to be more present on the Bordeaux computer scene, at the end of 2015 they moved to rue Poquelin Molière wich is smack in the middle of town in a gorgeous, typical Bordeaux style, building.

Since then bigger projects and more collaborations came their way and everything is still running smoothly for the firm.

I can't tell you too much about the future of the firm yet apart from the fact that it will continue to grow and make more partnerships with the surrounding development teams.
