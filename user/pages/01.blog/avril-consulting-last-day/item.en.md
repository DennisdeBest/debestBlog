After two months my time here is up so let me look back and reflect on my experiences here as an intern.

###The company

Avril Consulting has been a great place to be this summer, everyone is treated equal and everyone is approachable if you have any kind of questions. I would really like to thank them for having me here and all the time they have spent helping me get on my feet.

###The work 

I have had a really great time working on the projects, first off the proof of concept and later on project maintenance.
Working with a professional team has helped me grasp a lot of important things to take into account when building a project, from project management to version control and from debugging to deployment, the time spent here has been very valuable.

###The futur

All good things must come to an end, or do they ? Well, in this case, no they don't because I am happy to say that I will be doing my paid internship here as well all next year.

So thanks again to them for having me, and I shall see you when I'm back from vacation ;)
